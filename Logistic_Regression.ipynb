        "1. What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose\n",
        "- Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y).\n",
        "- It fits a straight line that best describes how X influences Y.\n",
        "- The purpose is to predict the value of Y based on X.\n",
        "- It also helps understand the strength and direction of the relationship between variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "- Linearity: The relationship between X and Y must be linear.\n",
        "- Independence: Observations must be independent of each other.\n",
        "- Homoscedasticity: The residuals must have constant variance.\n",
        "- Normality of residuals: Residuals should follow a normal distribution.\n",

        "5. What is the method of least squares in linear regression?\n",
        "- It is a technique to estimate regression coefficients.\n",
        "- It minimizes the sum of squared differences between actual and predicted Y values.\n",
        "- Ensures the best-fitting line through the data.\n",
        "- Produces unique values for slope and intercept.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is Logistic Regression? How does it differ from Linear Regression?\n",
        "- Logistic Regression predicts probabilities for classification problems (e.g., yes/no).\n",
        "- It uses a sigmoid function to map predictions between 0 and 1.\n",
        "- Linear Regression predicts continuous numeric values.\n",
        "- Linear Regression outputs real numbers, while Logistic Regression outputs class probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Name and briefly describe three common evaluation metrics for regression models\n",
        "- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) – Average of absolute differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
        "- Mean Squared Error (MSE) – Average of squared prediction errors (penalizes large errors).\n",
        "- R-squared (R²) – Measures how much variation in Y is explained by X.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the R-squared metric in regression analysis?\n",
        "- R² indicates the strength of the relationship between X and Y.\n",
        "- Ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values show better fit.\n",
        "- Shows the percentage of variability in Y explained by the model.\n",
        "- Helps compare multiple regression models."
